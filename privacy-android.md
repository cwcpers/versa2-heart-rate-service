# Fitbit Heart Rate Service - Privacy Policy

The "HR Service" Android app doesn't collect, transmit, or store any personal identifiable information.

# Permissions

* **Internet**: Required to allow the app to receive heart rate data from the Fitbit watch app, 
which occurs via a _local_ connection (never leaving the Android device).
* **Bluetooth**: Required to emulate a standard Bluetooth (BLE) heart rate monitor.
* **Location**: Required only for Bluetooth negotiation.  The app itself does nothing with this data.
